# Stack-Golang
The obligatory Stack repo.  Every new programming language I learn, this is almost always my first module I create....and since I am an old Forth programmer, my stack module is a lot more than just a Push &amp; Pop function.

This stack will take in any variable type, as it uses interfaces rather than specific var types.
